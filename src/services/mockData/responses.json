"question": "What does the Bible say about forgiveness?",
    "interpretation": "Forgiveness is simple but not easy. Here's how to do it: First, decide to forgive even if you don't feel like it - it's a choice, not a feeling. Second, pray for the person who hurt you (this helps your heart heal). Third, remember that forgiving doesn't mean trusting them again or pretending it didn't happen. You forgive to free yourself from anger and bitterness.",
