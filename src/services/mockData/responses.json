    "question": "What does the Bible say about forgiveness?",
    "interpretation": "Forgiveness is central to the Christian faith and personal healing. The Bible teaches that forgiveness is not optional but essential for spiritual and emotional well-being. When we forgive others, we release ourselves from the burden of bitterness and allow God's grace to work in our lives. This doesn't mean forgetting or excusing harmful behavior, but rather choosing to release the debt and trust God with justice.",

    "question": "How should I handle conflict with others?",
    "interpretation": "Biblical wisdom offers a transformative approach to conflict resolution that prioritizes relationship restoration over winning arguments. The scriptures teach us to approach conflict with humility, gentleness, and a desire for peace. This involves listening carefully, speaking truthfully in love, and seeking understanding rather than just being understood. The goal is not to avoid conflict but to handle it in a way that honors God and preserves relationships.",

But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."

    "question": "What is the meaning of true love?",
    "interpretation": "True love, according to scripture, is far more than emotion or attractionâ€”it is a choice to act in the best interests of another person. Biblical love is patient, kind, and selfless. It seeks the good of others even at personal cost. This love is demonstrated through actions, not just words, and it reflects God's own love for humanity. True love is sacrificial, unconditional, and enduring.",
    "verses": [
      {
        "reference": "1 Corinthians 13:4-8",
        "text": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."

    "question": "How can I overcome fear and anxiety?",
    "interpretation": "Fear and anxiety are natural human responses, but the Bible offers powerful antidotes through faith, prayer, and trust in God's character. Scripture repeatedly commands us not to fear, not because danger doesn't exist, but because God is greater than any threat we face. The key to overcoming fear is shifting our focus from the problem to God's power and presence. This requires active trust and the discipline of bringing our anxious thoughts to God in prayer.",
