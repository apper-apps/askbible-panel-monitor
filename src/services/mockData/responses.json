    "interpretation": "When life becomes overwhelming, you can find peace through these spiritual practices: First, release your worries through meditation or quiet reflection instead of holding them within.

"question": "What does the Bible say about forgiveness?",
    "interpretation": "Forgiveness is a profound spiritual practice that liberates your soul. Here's how to embrace it: First, choose forgiveness as an act of self-love, even when your emotions resist - it's a conscious decision, not a feeling. Second, send loving-kindness to the person who hurt you through meditation or positive intention (this transforms your own heart). Third, understand that forgiveness doesn't require trust or denial of what happened. You forgive to free yourself from the chains of resentment and open your heart to healing.",

"question": "How should I handle conflict with others?",
    "interpretation": "Spiritual wisdom teaches us to navigate disagreements with grace: First, approach the person with an open heart, speaking your truth calmly and privately. Second, listen deeply to their perspective without judgment, seeking to understand their soul's experience. Third, let your words be gentle even when emotions run high - harsh speech creates more suffering. Fourth, focus on healing and understanding rather than being right. The sacred goal is to preserve the connection between souls while honoring both your truths.",

But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."

"question": "What is the meaning of true love?",
    "interpretation": "True love is a spiritual force expressed through conscious action, not merely emotion. Here's how it manifests: First, cultivate patience when others trigger your reactions - this is love in practice. Second, extend kindness especially when someone is struggling with their own shadows. Third, sometimes place their spiritual wellbeing alongside your own in sacred reciprocity. Fourth, release the need to keep score of past hurts. Love is the choice to see the divine light within another soul and nurture it, even when it requires inner work.",

It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."

"question": "How can I overcome fear and anxiety?",
    "interpretation": "When fear and anxiety arise, you can transform them through spiritual practice: First, name your fears specifically in meditation or journaling - bringing them into conscious awareness diminishes their power. Second, remember that you are part of something infinitely greater than your current challenges, and this universal love supports your journey. Third, anchor yourself in the present moment rather than projecting into uncertain futures. Fourth, take inspired action on what you can influence, while surrendering what lies beyond your control to the wisdom of life itself.",
